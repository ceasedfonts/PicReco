## Understanding Google's ViT Model

Google's ViT (Vision Transformer) is a sophisticated image understanding program. Imagine it as a bright student that excels at comprehending images. Let's break down how it works:

- **Patches**: Instead of looking at an entire image all at once, ViT divides it into small parts called **patches**. Think of these as mini-picture snippets, like breaking a jigsaw puzzle into its pieces.

- **Learning from Patches**: Similar to how you learn from your lessons, ViT learns from these patches. It studies each patch to understand what's in it. For instance, one patch might contain a portion of a tree, while another holds a fragment of a car.

- **Assembling the Puzzle**: After learning from the patches, ViT organizes them in a sequence to make sense of the bigger picture. This is like reassembling the puzzle pieces to reveal the complete image. Once ViT knows what each patch represents, it can make an educated guess about the entire imageâ€”just like you can predict what a puzzle portrays as you fit most of the pieces together.

- **Building Memory**: ViT's cleverness doesn't end with patches. It builds a memory of what it learned from one image. This memory helps ViT understand other images more effectively. It's akin to you learning math skills and using them to solve various math problems.

In a nutshell, Google's ViT is comparable to an intelligent student. It learns from small image parts (patches), constructs a memory of its learnings, and then employs that memory to comprehend larger images. It's like a master puzzle solver, but for images!
